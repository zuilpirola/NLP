# NLP Assignment – Applying GloVe Embeddings
**Master’s Program in Data Science – Natural Language Processing**

## Overview
This repository contains the instructions for the **individual assignment** on applying **GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)** to a practical NLP task.  
The goal is to ensure that each student develops both theoretical understanding and hands-on experience with word embeddings in real applications.

## 🎯 Objective
Each student must:

1. Study and explain the GloVe embedding method with academic rigor.  
2. Apply GloVe to *one* NLP task of their choice (from the list below).  
3. Implement the full solution in a **Jupyter Notebook**.  
4. Submit all materials in a fully reproducible format.

## 📌 Choose One NLP Task
Select **only one** of the following tasks:

- Text Classification  
- Sentiment Analysis  
- Document Clustering  
- Semantic Similarity

# 📄 Deliverables

## 1. Written Report (Academic Style)
Your report must include:

### a) Theoretical Explanation
- What GloVe is.  
- How it works (co-occurrence matrix, cost function, weighting scheme).  
- Strengths, limitations, and intuition behind the method.  
- Comparison with at least one alternative embedding method (Word2Vec, FastText, or contextual embeddings such as BERT).

### b) Methodology
- Dataset description.  
- Preprocessing pipeline.  
- How GloVe embeddings were used in your models.  
- Model choice and justification.

### c) Experiments and Results
- Baseline (if applicable).  
- Model performance with GloVe.  
- Quantitative results and interpretation.  
- Discussion: insights, limitations, challenges.

### d) Conclusion
- Summary of findings and recommendations for future improvements.

## 2. Jupyter Notebook
Your notebook must:

- Contain all necessary code to reproduce your results.  
- Include clear Markdown explanations and comments.  
- Execute end-to-end without errors.  
- Cover preprocessing, embedding loading, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 3. Reproducibility Package
Your submission must include:

- Dataset or link to dataset.  
- `requirements.txt` or environment file.  
- Any extra instructions required to run the notebook.
